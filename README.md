# control-layer

*Draft. In progress.*

Firstly it was made
for [Keymacs layout](https://github.com/keyboard-ergonomics/keymacs)
but it can be applied to any other layout so I decided separate its
development. I used `Space` as modifier for passing to 3nd layer but
in practice any other key may be used. Though in my opinion `Space` is
the most comfortable for it.  Currently I
use [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape) for set up `Space` for
dual role.
